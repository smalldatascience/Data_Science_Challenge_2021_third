# Data Science Challenge 2021:

Alexander Huber analyzed the growth of the insurance industry in Austria and selected EU countries. For this purpose, he took a closer look at the development of balance sheet totals, premium volume and other items of insurance companies in Austria and selected EU countries over time and made comparisons between countries and between the insurance sectors. In addition, the trends in these items were also compared to the economic growth of the states (growth of the real GDP) to determine whether the insurance industry in those states was outperforming or underperforming the overall economy of those states.
